[essence::core_concept]
SAGE is a convention that organizes knowledge into scroll-like `.rag` files using clearly defined categories and semantic sections. It serves as a universal translator between human pedagogy and AI reasoning, allowing seamless interpretation, communication, and knowledge transfer.

[essence::story]
In a future where AI co-authors knowledge with humans, SAGE acts like a scroll carried by a sage—modular, evolving, and interpretable by all. It empowers AI not only to learn but to teach and collaborate.
