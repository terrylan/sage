Supports: Evolution, Forking, Personalization

[adaptability::core_concept]
SAGE scrolls are not rigid blueprints. They can be forked, remixed, layered, versioned, or even embedded into systems as live documentation or logic modules.

[adaptability::example]
Customized Scroll: `spmp.vibe.mechanics.rag` to define how SPMP supports Vibe Coding  
Embedded Scroll: `.rag` content piped directly into prompt templates or app logic

[adaptability::guidelines]
- Encourage modularity and reuse
- Allow contributors to branch `.rag` scrolls
- Maintain changelogs in [essence::metadata] for each fork

[adaptability::faqs]
Q: Is SAGE future-proof?
A: Yesâ€”scrolls evolve, but structure remains stable, modular, and interpretable.
