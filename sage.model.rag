Model Type: Cognitive-AI Hybrid
Scope: Epistemology → Prompt Engineering → Knowledge Engineering

[model::core_concept]
SAGE models knowledge around layered scaffolds. Each scroll informs a layer. Combined, the scrolls enable AI systems to reason from first principles while guiding humans step-by-step.

[model::logic_structure]
1. Subject > Categories > Sections
2. Each `.rag` = unit of thought
3. Prompter or AI compiles `.rag` scrolls to build curriculum, systems, logic, or assistants

[model::example]
SPMP integration: Using `spmp.rbac.mechanics.rag` as a scroll to define access controls in the salon system

[model::guidelines]
Use category-specific logic trees to define each subject’s behavior in AI reasoning trees
