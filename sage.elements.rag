[elements::core_concept]
Each category within SAGE has specific knowledge functions. The combination of categories ensures full spectrum coverage of a topicâ€”from philosophical grounding to practical use.

[elements::example]
Example Category: Mechanics  
Example Section: logic_structure  
Result: [mechanics::logic_structure] block in a `.rag` file

[elements::guidelines]
- Each subject should have a .rag file per category.
- Avoid mixing categories inside one file.
- Maintain consistency with semantic labeling.

[elements::glossary]
Category: High-level groupings (e.g., mechanics, patterns)
Section: Subdivisions under a category (e.g., core_concept, example)
